        <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
        <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you 
          must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set 
          of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. 
          This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you 
          made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a <i>goal state;</i> if 
          you didn't, it isn't.</p>
        <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good 
          leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or 
          all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, 
          you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get 
          to a leaf.</p>
        <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <i>backtrack</i> to continue the search 
          for a good leaf by revoking your <i>most recent</i> choice, and trying out the 
          next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice 
          that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the 
          root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
        <p>This needs an example.</p><center>

            <ol>
              <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
              <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
              <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
              <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
              <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
              <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
              <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
              <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
              <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>

            <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model 
              of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure 
              called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices 
              we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is 
              called <i>depth-first tree searching.</i>)</p>

            <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node

                <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a <i>boolean</i> function. This is 
                  essential to understanding the algorithm. If <code><font color="brown" size="4">solve(n)</font></code> is true, 
                  that means node <code><font color="brown" size="4">n</font></code> is part of a solution--that is, node<code><font color="brown" size="4"> n </font>  
                  </code>is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say 
                  that<code><font color="brown" size="4"> n </font> </code>is <i>solvable</i>. If<code><font color="brown" size="4"> solve(n)</font> </code>is false, then there is <i>no</i> path that includes<code><font color="brown" size="4"> n </font></code> to any goal node.</p>
                  <p>How does this work?</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If any child of<code><font color="brown" size="4"> n </font> </code>is solvable, then<code> <font color="brown" size="4"> n </font> </code>is solvable.</li>
                    <li>If no child of<code> <font color="brown" size="4"> n </font> </code>is solvable, then<code> <font color="brown" size="4"> n </font> </code>is not solvable.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node<code> <font color="brown" size="4"> n </font> </code>is solvable (part 
                    of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of<code> 
                    <font color="brown" size="4"> n </font> </code>is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of<code> <font color="brown" size="4"> n </font></code>. 
                    In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
                  <pre><font color="brown" size="4">       for each child c of n {

                          return false </font></pre>
                  <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the

                    it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by

        <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are 
          the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and these are only 
          pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe 
          a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known 
          that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root 
          node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes 
          at all, and no solution to the problem.</p>
        <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form 
          (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.</p>
        <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information 
          is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the 
          recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) 
          printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array.</p>
        <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in 
          reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>

          Keeping backtracking simple</font></b></p>
        <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but 
          when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. 
          Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: for example, if 
          the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves 
          are the checkmate and stalemate solutions. </p>
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. 
          In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing 
          a<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> gameOver </Font></code>method (or you could even call it<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> isLeaf</Font></code>). 
          This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any 
          possible moves remain.</p>
        <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each 
          node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already (so 
          we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, 
          by just saying <code><Font color="brown" size="4">for&nbsp;each&nbsp;child&nbsp;c&nbsp;of&nbsp;n </Font></code>. 
          In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, 
          and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, 
          a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child 
          of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal 
          move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones 
          you've already examined?</p>
        <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have 
          been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you 
          first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each 
          child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining 
          untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, 
          but it may require quite a lot of additional work.</p>
        <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, <b>if</b> 
          you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you 
          know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.</p>
        <p>For example, you might be able to number the children<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> 1 </Font></code> through<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> 
          n </Font></code>, and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried child<code> <Font color="brown" size="4">
          k</font></code>, you know that you have already tried children<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> 1 </Font></code>through<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> 
          k-1 </Font></code>, and you have not yet tried children<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> k+1 </Font></code> through<code> 
          n</code>. Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can 
          always try red first, then yellow, then green, then blue. If child yellow fails, 
          you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices 
          in the order left, straight, right (or perhaps north, east, south, west).</p>
        <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. 
          In the chess game example, you might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares 
          of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may 
          also have several moves, and these must also be ordered.</p>
        <p>You can probably find some way to order the children of a node. If the ordering 
          scheme is simple enough, you should use it; but if it is too cumbersome, you 
          are better off keeping a list of untried children.</p>
        <p><b><font size="4"><br>
          Example: TreeSearch</font></b></p>
        <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which 
          is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary 
          tree.</p>
        <p>A <b>binary tree </b>is a data structure composed of <b>nodes</b>. One node 
          is designated as the <b>root node</b>. Each node can reference (point to) zero, 
          one, or two other nodes, which are called its <b>children</b>. The children 
          are referred to as the <b>left child</b> and/or the <b>right child</b>. All 
          nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are 
          no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of 
          a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and 
          will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) 
          shows a binary tree.</p>

              <p><b><font size="4"><br>
                What are the children?</font></b></p>
              <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at 
                each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous choices 
                don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you 
                know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, 
                however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.</p>
              <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem 
                of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted the countries 
                are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that 
                share a border are the same color.</p>
              <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for 
                the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored. There are two 
                ways to do this:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Method 1. </b>Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you 
                  run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
                <li><b>Method 2. </b>Try only those colors that have not already been used for 
                  an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of countries, you 
                  have successfully colored the map.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. 
                This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
              <p>In both methods, the colors are represented by integers, from<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> RED=1 </Font></code>to<code><Font color="brown" size="4"> 
                BLUE=4</Font></code>. We define the following helper methods. The helper method code 
                isn't displayed here because it's not important for understanding the method 
                that does the backtracking.</p>

              <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 
                1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods <i>could</i> 
                have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of 
                its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, 
                by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically 
                guaranteed. <i> <b>If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set

                Debugging techniques</b></font></p>
              <p> Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers 
                are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. 
                There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These 
                tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are 
                trying to debug recursive routines.</p>
              <p><b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits. </b>Often, the 
                best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least 
                the most important ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what 
                parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just 
                print a long list of these, it's hard to match up me. </tbody></table>
